This poster was presented at Quantitative BioImaging 2020, a conference on advances in biological optical and electron microscopy data analysis. The poster focuses on a pipeline for de-noising light sheet microscopy images of rat pyrimidal neurons and producing functional and biologically realistic ODE-based single neuron simulations for analysis of intracellular calcium dynamics and neuronal integration.
