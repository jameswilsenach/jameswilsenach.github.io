In this paper we provide new maximum entropy model selection and random-walk-based community ranking methods for analysing state space models of brain dynamics as a dynamic multtiplex network. We validated our method using the meta-analysis tool NeuroSynth (now [NiMARE](https://nimare.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)).
