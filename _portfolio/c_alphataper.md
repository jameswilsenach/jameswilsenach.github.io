This code is an improved implementation of the original method by Rohani and Miramontes (Mathematical Medicine and Biology, 2004) for determining the alpha scaling exponent in coloured noise processes. Updated to more effectively work with realistically limited data sets using a multitaper approach to spectral analysis.<br/><img src='/images/scaling.png'>
