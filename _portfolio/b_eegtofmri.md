title: "EEGtofMRI: Assistive UI Navigation with Brain-Computer Interfaces (Python/Tensorflow)"
excerpt: "[This](https://github.com/jameswilsenach/EEGtofMRI) is an early concept personal project to learn a generalised translation from EEG to parcillated cortical fMRI using simultaneous EEG/fMRI recordings and comparing different ANN architectures. According to the works of Grooms et al. and others, EEG correlates weakly with cortical fMRI BOLD signal in particular, low frequency and alpha bands. The project is still in its early stages and more sophisticated models (e.g. Deep LSTM networks) and features (e.g. EMD-derived low frequency IMFs etc.) are needed to improve it.

Unibrowser: Assistive UI Navigation with Brain-Computer Interfaces (Python/MATLAB)"
excerpt: "Unibrowser is a BCI-based User Interface (UI) navigation tool, originally designed for the BR41N.IO BCI Designers Hackathon in Bari Italy, hosted by g.tec neurotechnology and part of the IEEE Systems, Man and Cybernetics Conference. Unibrowser is an assistive technology for helping users with limited maneauverability navigate complex UIs such as websites or Operating Systems using only mental push commands. Unibrowser is designed to intelligently select simple yes/no questions for the user to answer, thereby narrowing down to users desired destination in only a few steps. Unibrowser works using a simple Bayesian framework but has many avenues for improvement and expansion (see [repository notes](https://github.com/michaelgoldendev/unibrowser)). Unibrowser won the BCI Designer's [Brain Prize](https://www.br41n.io/Bari-2019#projects).
