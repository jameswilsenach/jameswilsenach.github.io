EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are becoming increasingly popular, with products such as the Muse Headband and g-tec’s Unicorn Hybrid Black taking off, while in the protein folding space, Fold It and distributed/crowd computing efforts like Fold@home, don’t seem to be talked about as much as they once were.

Game-ification is still just as effective a tool to harness human ingenuity as it once was, so perhaps what is needed is a new approach to crowd-folding efforts that can tap into the full potential of the human mind to manipulate and visualise new 3D structures, by drawing inspiration directly from the minds of users…
